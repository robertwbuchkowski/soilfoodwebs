## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Ensured that all Description lines are close to 80 characters

* Added relevant literature to the Description

* Changed T and F to TRUE and FALSE

* Reset the users plot settings in the vignette

* Note: Two DOIs were raising flags in the checks, but are correct.
