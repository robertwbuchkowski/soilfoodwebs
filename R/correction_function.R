#' A function to correct stoichiometry dynamically
#'
#' @param biomasses A vector of biomasses.
#' @param cij The consumption matrix from Cijfcn
#' @param CN A vector of C:N ratios.
#' @param p A vector of production efficiency.
#' @param a A vector of assimilation efficiency.
#' @param canIMM A Boolean vector of whether the nodes can immobilize nitrogen.
#' @param dietlimits The diet limits matrix for the stoichiometry correction (proportion of diet)?
#' @param diet_correct Boolean: Does the organism correct it's diet?
#' @param Conly Boolean: Is the model meant for carbon only?
#' @param Immobilizationlimit This is the limit of the amount of nitrogen the food web can immobilize nitrogen (NOT PLANTS). This will impact the calculations of inorganic nitrogen dynamics.
#' @return Returns the consumption rates (FMAT) and production efficiencies (p).
#' @details
#' This function takes inputs from the ODE and outputs corrected consumption rates.
#' The key difference from 'corrstoich' is that the prey DO NOT correct their feeding rates to compensate for higher consumption from the predators, so the system can leave equilibrium if a diet shift occurs.
