Description: Analyzing soil food webs or any food web 
    measured at equilibrium. The package analyzes them at equilibirum 
    by calculating fluxes and stability properties. The package can also
    manipulate the structure of the food web by adding, removing, and
    combining species. Finally, it can simulate food webs away from 
    equilibrium and run decomposition experiments.
